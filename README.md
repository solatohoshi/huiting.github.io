This is my personal portfolio
My personal portfolio consists of 3 webpages, including home, resume and courses I've taken.
This project is one of my course assignment of web development. We were asked to build our own 
website using html, css, and javascript. While I followed the assignment requirements, I also
added some personalized contents. I designed my website's wireframe and layout using Figma.
I also used Bootstrap components and my own css to build a visually-pleasant user interface.
