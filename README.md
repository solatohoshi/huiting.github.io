# Introduction
This is an updated portfolio website built with React, featuring self-designed illustrations and improved UI. 
The web app is responsive on all devices, providing smooth user experience.

The website is deployed through Github pages: https://solatohoshi.github.io/huitingPortfolio/
I followed this tutorial for deployment: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages?tab=readme-ov-file

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
